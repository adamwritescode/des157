1. Dr. Chloe (http://drchloe.com/anxietytools/)
	- Informative, possibly preventative, not for “right now”/emergency state
	- UI jumps around
	- Extremely difficult to learn and focus during an anxiety/panic attack
	- Assets: Website
	- Lots of clicking involved
	- Could incorporate information from this site into project; info is easy to understand and well-categorized (but no insomnia)
	- Forms are a deterrent, esp. during a panic attack
	- User flow is confusing & end doesn’t have resolve
2. Sleep With Me Podcast/Website
	- Blathering can actually cause anxiety (due to lack of feeling grounded)
	- Monotone voice (+)
	- Accessible thru website + podcast apps
	- No visual component (as with all audio podcasts)
	- Assets: Podcast, Website




For the comparative research component of this project, I explored one website and one podcast that were related to my prospective final project idea: an online toolkit of visual and audible media designed to help alleviate anxiety as well as anxiety-related insomnia. 

The website that I explored was Dr. Chloe Carmichael’s Anxiety Management Toolbox, located at http://drchloe.com/anxiety-tools/. The main takeaway from this site was that it had a lot of information that could potentially help prevent anxiety or panic attacks, but did not, in my opinion (based on my personal experiences with anxiety<sup>*</sup>) appear to have great potential for help <em>during</em> an anxiety or panic attack. The user interface changes often, and I felt like I was never quite sure where I was in the site structure. It eventually became apparent that the anxiety tools are arranged somewhat like a slide deck separated into sections/chapters, and that you have to click through each ‘slide’ to advance, using buttons that look like they belong in an audio player.

From my experience, it is extremely difficult to focus, concentrate or learn during an anxiety/panic state; therefore, to be able to navigate through a site like this must be very difficult during those experiences, as I was confused while navigating the site while in a normal state of being. 




<p>*<em>Note: My evaluation on some aspects of both Dr. Chloe’s website and the Sleep With Me podcast are based on my own experience with anxiety and panic attacks. Other individuals could have completely different needs, and I intend to look into this more during my continuing research.</p>
