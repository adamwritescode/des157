                <p>I will preface this post by saying that, while I don’t use this form often, I have used it often enough in the past few weeks to become completely frustrated.</p>

                <p>It seems simple enough - all fields are labeled clearly and there’s no guesswork involved. Except with one field - and this is where the big problem lies.</p>

                <p>The field labeled, “Please enter all the Majors you plan to declare, and the degree type (AB/BS) for each:” had me wondering how exactly I would need to input the major name AND the degree type. I assumed that it was probably a free text field, i.e. little to no input validation. I was very wrong!</p>

                <p>I tried "Design - AB". Then I tried "Design (AB)". Then I tried "Design, AB"; and so on, until I gave up. I kept receiving error messages throughout the week after multiple attempts.</p>

                <p>Finally, by what I'm &lt;label&gt;ing (ha) a stroke of good luck, I was able to get through to a confirmation screen. The magic combination was:</p>

                <p>Design
                <br>AB</p>
                <aside>
                    <figure>

                    </figure>
                </aside>
                <p>I have two main thoughts on this flaw: 1. If the powers that be wanted that specific format (free text field, with input separated on two lines) they should have stated so explicitly, while providing an example or two; 2. A “smarter” form could have solved the issue. “Smarter” meaning it includes some kind of logic which might hide or show dropdown menus with hard-coded values based on your student data (this would require being logged into the UCD system.)</p>

                <p>In short: some simple adjustments could save users a ton of grief.</p>
                <p>I wonder how many others have had this issue?</p>

                    <!-- begin post content-->
                        <p>Facebook is used by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/">over 1 billion people every day</a>, and designing for so many people must have its challenges. With so many active users at their disposal, and thus a large data pool of insight into the way people use Facebook, it makes sense that they would make seemingly constant incrememntal changes to the interface.</p>

                        <p>That being said, there are a number of changes that have been implemented that seem fairly disruptive; and that's coming for a fairly tech-savvy person who is no stranger to web apps and social media. For instance, major navigation items switch places with others, change icons, or disappear entirely (or collapsed into a different part of the app).</p>

                        </aside>
                        <p>These particular decisions to modify the UI are annoying, but seem fairly benign in their intent. Other changes, however, seem a little more questionable in nature. For instance, the decision to swap out the messenger app icon (which I tap often) in the middle of the bottom nav bar for a marketplace icon (which I never use) makes me think that they're intentionally trying to trick users to spend money (probably through their own payment system, I'm guessing.)</p>

                        <p>Otherwise, the visual design of the main content (timeline) is fine by me - it works well enough. Each post is easily discernible because of their 'encapsulation'; each post is seperated by a small top and bottom margin which appears as a thin grey bar. The visual heirarchy is generally easy to follow; user and page names are bold and black-on-white, with secondary information or options appearing smaller and lighter, though still easy to see.</p>
