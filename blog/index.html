                <h2 class="post-title">Using p5.js to Create a Zen Sand Garden</h2>
              </header>
              <div class="post-content">
                <p>The 5th studio assignment was to explore a JavaScript library and to create a demo showcasing some of its functionality. The goal was to get familiar with said library so that it may be used to build components of the upcoming final project. I intent to build a stress-relieving virtual outdoor Zen garden for my final project, and I decided that the sand area of the outdoor garden would be a good component to focus on for this assignment. </p>

                <p>I knew what kind of functionality I’d need for the sand garden: ability to render shapes/particles (a LOT of them), mouse collision detection (between the mouse cursor and the particles), mouse “drawing” (to push the particles and leave an imprint), and image importing/displaying (to potentially add a background image or swap the mouse cursor with an image of a rake or other tool), and &lt;canvas&gt; support. </p>

                <p>I also knew that I’d likely need to stay in a 2D environment; though 3D libraries and WebGL definitely pique my interest, I needed to be realistic as far as what could be accomplished in a few days (which were already split between other classes.) </p>

                <p>After sifting through pages of JS libraries, I only a few options to choose from that, I thought, could’ve potentially suited the needs of my project: two.js, particles.js and p5.js.</p>

                <p>I evaluated particles.js first; and while the demo page looked impressive and highly customizable, I noticed that performance greatly decreased as the particle count (and other attributes) were modified. As I adjusted the particle count, Chrome crashed before a satisfactory number of particles were rendered; thus, that library was out. </p>

                <p>Next up was p5js. I was already fairly comfortable with Processing, so I decided to dive in and attempt to code a quick prototype/proof of concept. “Quick” turned out to equate to several hours and multiple do-overs. What I wanted to do seemed simple: fill the canvas with pixels and then have each pixel move when the mouse was within a certain distance; however, it proved to be far more challenging than I had anticipated. I successfully rendered a canvas full of points of randomized greyscale values and had their x and y values stored in a 2D array, but I couldn’t modify their locations even when changing the coordinates in the array. I spent hours trying to accomplish this in various ways, but nothing worked. I put p5js on hold for the time being.</p>

                <p>Last was two.js, which seemed especially appealing given that its documentation page boasted something about having all two.js shapes stored and easily accessible/modifiable. I was almost certain this would be the winner, but after doing some more research, I realized that a lot of the interactivity I needed was not natively supported, and thus would be difficult to implement. </p>

                <p>Back to p5js. After posting on the class discussion page, our professor suggested I create objects instead of primitive shapes. Lightbulb moment. After a few more attempts (and several more hours trying to debug what ended up being a painfully simple error) I finally had the very basic functionality I needed - the mouse cursor could move sand particles around the canvas. Unfortunately, there are some performance (low FPS) issues, so I’m going to look more closely into the concept of “particle systems” per our TA’s suggestion, as well as code optimization. </p>

                <p>I think that p5js gives you a lot of bang for your buck. It is very versatile, easy to use, and you can build surprisingly impressive projects without being a coding guru. Most of my complaints have to do with the documentation and community (or lack there of). The documentation pages are vague at times, some advanced examples don’t include many comments, and google searches on specific problems don’t prove very fruitful. The forums are fairly inactive, and the p5js subreddit is a ghost town. If there were a more active community (or had posted in the class discussions earlier), I probably wouldn’t have had very many pain points. Either way, this was a great learning experience, and my programming skills have definitely improved. </p>

                <h2 class="post-title">Evaluating the UCD Degree Check Form</h2>
              </header>
              <div class="post-content">
                <p>I will preface this post by saying that, while I don’t use this form often, I have used it often enough in the past few weeks to become completely frustrated.</p>

                <p>It seems simple enough - all fields are labeled clearly and there’s no guesswork involved. Except with one field - and this is where the big problem lies.</p>

                <p>The field labeled, “Please enter all the Majors you plan to declare, and the degree type (AB/BS) for each:” had me wondering how exactly I would need to input the major name AND the degree type. I assumed that it was probably a free text field, i.e. little to no input validation. I was very wrong!</p>

                    </figure>
                </aside>
                <p>I tried "Design - AB". Then I tried "Design (AB)". Then I tried "Design, AB"; and so on, until I gave up. I kept receiving error messages throughout the week after multiple attempts.</p>

                <p>Finally, by what I'm &lt;label&gt;ing (ha) a stroke of good luck, I was able to get through to a confirmation screen. The magic combination was:</p>

                <p>Design
                <br>AB</p>
                <aside>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/degree-form02.png" alt="screenshot of confirmed submission of degree check form" width="483" height="158">
                        <figcaption>UCD Degree Check Form</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                </aside>
                <p>I have two main thoughts on this flaw: 1. If the powers that be wanted that specific format (free text field, with input separated on two lines) they should have stated so explicitly, while providing an example or two; 2. A “smarter” form could have solved the issue. “Smarter” meaning it includes some kind of logic which might hide or show dropdown menus with hard-coded values based on your student data (this would require being logged into the UCD system.)</p>

                <p>In short: some simple adjustments could save users a ton of grief.</p>
                <p>I wonder how many others have had this issue?</p>

                    <h2 class="post-title">Brief commentary on Facebook's mobile UI (iOS)</h2>
                </header>
                    <div class="post-content">
                    <!-- begin post content-->
                        <p>Facebook is used by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/">over 1 billion people every day</a>, and designing for so many people must have its challenges. With so many active users at their disposal, and thus a large data pool of insight into the way people use Facebook, it makes sense that they would make seemingly constant incrememntal changes to the interface.</p>

                        <p>That being said, there are a number of changes that have been implemented that seem fairly disruptive; and that's coming for a fairly tech-savvy person who is no stranger to web apps and social media. For instance, major navigation items switch places with others, change icons, or disappear entirely (or collapsed into a different part of the app).</p>
                        <aside>
                            <figure>
                                <img src="images/facebook-ui.PNG" alt="screenshot of facebook ui on iOS" width="311" height="552">

                        </aside>
                        <p>These particular decisions to modify the UI are annoying, but seem fairly benign in their intent. Other changes, however, seem a little more questionable in nature. For instance, the decision to swap out the messenger app icon (which I tap often) in the middle of the bottom nav bar for a marketplace icon (which I never use) makes me think that they're intentionally trying to trick users to spend money (probably through their own payment system, I'm guessing.)</p>

                        <p>Otherwise, the visual design of the main content (timeline) is fine by me - it works well enough. Each post is easily discernible because of their 'encapsulation'; each post is seperated by a small top and bottom margin which appears as a thin grey bar. The visual heirarchy is generally easy to follow; user and page names are bold and black-on-white, with secondary information or options appearing smaller and lighter, though still easy to see.</p>
