                        <p>Facebook is used by <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/346167/facebook-global-dau/">over 1 billion people every day</a>, and designing for so many people must have its challenges. With so many active users at their disposal, and thus a large data pool of insight into the way people use Facebook, it makes sense that they would make seemingly constant incrememntal changes to the interface.</p>

                        <p>That being said, there are a number of changes that have been implemented that seem fairly disruptive; and that's coming for a fairly tech-savvy person who is no stranger to web apps and social media. For instance, major navigation items switch places with others, change icons, or disappear entirely (or collapsed into a different part of the app).</p>

                        </aside>
                        <p>These particular decisions to modify the UI are annoying, but seem fairly benign in their intent. Other changes, however, seem a little more questionable in nature. For instance, the decision to swap out the messenger app icon (which I tap often) in the middle of the bottom nav bar for a marketplace icon (which I never use) makes me think that they're intentionally trying to trick users to spend money (probably through their own payment system, I'm guessing.)</p>

                        <p>Otherwise, the visual design of the main content (timeline) is fine by me - it works well enough. Each post is easily discernible because of their 'encapsulation'; each post is seperated by a small top and bottom margin which appears as a thin grey bar. The visual heirarchy is generally easy to follow; user and page names are bold and black-on-white, with secondary information or options appearing smaller and lighter, though still easy to see.</p>
