      <h2>Axis Vidius Mini Drone &amp; Controller</h2>
      <p>The Axis Vidius is a very small (about 2" x 2" x 1") remote-controlled quadcopter drone, which makes for a great desk toy. This mini drone is a lot of fun to play with during homework breaks (it flies for about 6 minutes on a full charge, so I'm not distracted for too long), and is also pretty effective at annoying my cat. Though it was a little bit pricey for its size (I think I paid $100), the selling point was the tiny 480p camera on the front that allows for first-person viewing &amp; recording from a mobile device.</p>

      <h2>Record: Intronaut - The Direction of Last Things</h2>
      <p>Intronaut has become one of my favorite bands in recent years. They create a very thoughtfully-crafted blend of metal, prog rock and jazz, with vocals that alternate between clean singing and mid-range death metal growls. This album is their latest release; and though it came out in 2015, I still listen to it often. The album artwork (not pictured) and the green/black splattered vinyl create an experience that immerses me in the music every time I listen. Physical media (especially vinyl) isn't dead - don't let people tell you otherwise!</p>

      <h2>Razer BlackWidow Ultimate Mechanical Keyboard</h2>
      <p>I first heard some buzz about mechanical keyboards around 2014, and my interest has been piqued since. I finally decided to take the plunge at the start of this quarter (thanks, financial aid!) and I'm so glad I did! Though it was hard to justify spending close to $100 on a keyboard, I decided to just do it since I knew I'd be coding every day. Mechanical keyboards use mechanical switches instead of rubber membranes under each key. These switches create tactile and audible feedback which make you feel like a boss when typing (and especially writing code!) This particular keyboard also has programmable LEDs under the keys, which make typing in the dark both easier and more enjoyable.</p>
